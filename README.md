# Elaine_Kouame_Project
The goal of this project is to write a program that extract the cage number and genotype of mice in the excell database that match the set criteria. The overall goal is to write code to select mice ready for experiments, ready to be weeaned or need to be sacked.
In cell 1-5, we have imported the module openpyxl which allow python to read an excel workbook. Having opened the file, we create an empty set whose values will be cage number and genotyping. We iterate through the IRF1 Ko worksheet and look for two conditions : age is not an empty string ( because there are empty column in the excell file) and age is an integer greater than 23. Print cage number and genotyping of mice that meet both conditions only.
In cell 6-10,we wrote a function that given the worksheet look for cage number and genotype of mice that meet requirements needed which in this case are : age value is not an empty string and not "none" and greater than 23. we tested the function for "il12a ko" sheet.
